# Welcome to Our Tenant Community

We are the Excelsiorhaus Mietergemeinschaft — a group of tenants coming together to share information, support one another, and make our home an even better place to live.
Everyone who lives in Excelsiorhaus is welcome to join. Whether you’ve been here for years or just moved in, this is your community too!

We want this house to become a welcoming home for all. We as neighbors build a community that supports and cares for each other.
Life is better if you have good neighbors to rely on and to share time with.
